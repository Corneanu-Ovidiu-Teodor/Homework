# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver

This project implements algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Java. The TSP is a classic optimization problem in which the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

## Overview

The application provides implementations of three search algorithms:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search

Each algorithm aims to find the optimal solution to the TSP by exploring different search strategies.

## Features

- Random generation of distance matrix representing cities and distances between them.
- Implementation of BFS, UCS, and A* search algorithms for solving the TSP.
- Modular and well-commented code for easy understanding and extension.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
3. Navigate to the project directory:
4. Compile the Java files:
5. Run the main class to execute the program:

## Usage

1. Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of cities for the TSP.
2. The application will generate a random graph representing the cities and distances between them.
3. It will then execute each algorithm (BFS, UCS, and A*) to find the optimal solution.
4. The results, including the total cost, route, and execution time for each algorithm, will be displayed.
